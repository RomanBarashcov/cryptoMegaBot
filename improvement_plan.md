## Current Sprint Focus
- Complete Trading Strategy improvements
- Implement risk management features
- Add comprehensive tests for new components
- **[NEW]** Run multi-month backtests with TP/SL/leverage sweeps and log all trades
- **[NEW]** Compare bot performance to analog bots and optimize logic

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining risk management features
2. Add more technical indicators
3. Begin implementing machine learning models
4. Start working on market regime detection
5. **[NEW]** Automate backtest result analysis and reporting
6. **[NEW]** Use trade logs to iteratively optimize strategy logic and parameters

## Notes
- All new components have been thoroughly tested
- Performance analytics and optimization tools are now available
- Risk management features are partially implemented
- Need to focus on adding more technical indicators and ML models
- **[NEW]** Backtest and trade log analysis workflow is now part of the core improvement cycle
