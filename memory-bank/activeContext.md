## Next Steps

### Short-term Goals
1. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls
   - Add recovery mechanisms for critical failures
   - Improve error logging with context information

2. **Improve Trading Strategy**
   - Implement technical indicators (Moving Averages, RSI)
   - Add volume analysis for entry/exit decisions
   - Implement trend detection algorithm

3. **Enhance Monitoring**
   - Add detailed performance metrics
   - Implement periodic status reporting
   - Create better visualization of trading history

4. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Add unit tests for core components
   - Implement integration tests with API mocks
   - Create test fixtures for database operations

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Add Notification System**
   - Implement email alerts for critical events
   - Add Telegram bot integration for status updates
   - Create daily performance reports

2. **Improve Risk Management**
   - Implement dynamic position sizing based on volatility
   - Add circuit breaker for unusual market conditions
   - Create drawdown limits to pause trading

3. **Enhance Configuration**
   - Add support for configuration profiles
   - Implement hot-reloading of configuration
   - Create configuration validation tool

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **SQLite vs. PostgreSQL**
   - Decision: Using SQLite for simplicity and embedded operation
   - Trade-off: Limited concurrency but sufficient for single-instance bot
   - Consideration: May need to migrate to PostgreSQL if scaling becomes necessary

2. **WebSocket vs. REST API for Price Updates**
   - Decision: Using WebSocket for real-time price updates
   - Benefit: Lower latency and reduced API call count
   - Implementation: Added robust reconnection handling with exponential backoff

3. **Fixed vs. Dynamic Position Sizing**
   - Decision: Currently using fixed position sizing (1 ETH)
   - Consideration: Evaluating dynamic sizing based on account balance and volatility
   - Next step: Implement and test dynamic sizing algorithm

### Open Questions
1. How to handle extended market downtime or API outages?
2. What additional metrics should be tracked for performance evaluation?
3. How to optimize the balance between trade frequency and profit per trade?
4. Should we implement a machine learning component for strategy optimization?

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Separate concerns into distinct packages (config, database, trading)
- Use interfaces for testability and flexibility
- Keep main.go focused on initialization and coordination

### Error Handling
- Propagate errors with context
- Log errors at the point of handling
- Use custom error types for specific error conditions
- Recover from panics in critical goroutines

### Configuration Management
- Use environment variables for all configurable parameters
- Provide sensible defaults for optional parameters
- Validate configuration at startup
- Document all configuration options

### Database Operations
- Use prepared statements for all queries
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Use transactions for related operations
- Keep database schema in version-controlled SQL files

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
1. WebSocket connections require careful management for stability
2. SQLite performs well for this use case but requires careful concurrency handling
3. Go's concurrency model works well for this type of application
4. Error handling in distributed systems requires careful consideration

### Trading Insights
1. Small, consistent profits compound effectively over time
2. Strict risk management is essential for long-term success
3. Trading strategy must adapt to changing market conditions
4. Emotional detachment is a key advantage of automated trading

### Project Management Insights
1. Clear documentation is essential for configuration and operation
2. Incremental development with focused goals works well
3. Regular testing in testnet environment prevents costly mistakes
4. Monitoring and logging are as important as the trading logic itself
