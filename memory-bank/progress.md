## Current Status

### Project Status: Beta (estimated)
The bot has core functionality, basic strategies, indicators, risk management, and testing in place. Requires further refinement, testing, and feature completion before production.

### Development Status
- **Last Major Update**: Implementation of strategy framework, indicators, risk manager, analytics, and testing infrastructure.
- **Current Focus**: Refining existing strategies, improving error handling, potentially adding dynamic sizing.
- **Next Milestone**: Implementing dynamic position sizing or more advanced strategies.

### Testing Status
- **Unit Tests**: Partially implemented across core modules (Service, Repository, Risk, Strategy, Analytics, Optimizer). Coverage needs improvement.
- **Integration Tests**: Not yet implemented.
- **Manual Testing**: Basic functionality tested in testnet environment.
- **Backtesting**: Framework available for strategy evaluation.

### Deployment Status
- **Environment**: Local development only
- **Containerization**: Docker configuration complete but not fully tested
- **Production Readiness**: Not ready for production use

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **WebSocket Stability**: ✅ FIXED - Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - **Previous Impact**: Bot could miss price updates and trading opportunities
   - **Solution**: Added robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - **Benefits**: Improved reliability, no manual intervention needed for connection drops

2. **Error Handling**: Some API errors are not properly handled
   - **Impact**: Bot may crash on certain API failures
   - **Workaround**: Monitor bot and restart if necessary
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement comprehensive error handling for all API calls

### Major Issues
1. **Trading Strategy Refinement**: Implemented strategies (e.g., MA Crossover) may need tuning or replacement with more robust ones.
   - **Impact**: Suboptimal trading decisions.
   - **Workaround**: Use backtesting/optimization frameworks; configure existing strategies carefully.
   - **Planned Fix**: Develop and test more advanced strategies.

2. **Position Sizing**: Fixed position size doesn't account for volatility
   - **Impact**: Risk may be too high in volatile conditions
   - **Workaround**: Manually adjust position size in configuration
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement dynamic position sizing based on volatility

### Minor Issues
1. **Logging Verbosity/Structure**: Basic logging exists, but may lack sufficient detail or structure for complex debugging.
   - **Impact**: Can be harder to diagnose subtle issues.
   - **Workaround**: Enhance logging calls in specific areas as needed.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement more structured/configurable logging.

2. **Configuration**: No validation for some parameters
   - **Impact**: Invalid configuration may cause unexpected behavior
   - **Workaround**: Carefully check configuration before starting
   - **Planned Fix**: Add comprehensive configuration validation

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Trading Strategy Evolution
1. **Initial Approach**: Simple market order entry with fixed TP/SL.
   - **Rationale**: Proof of concept.
   - **Outcome**: Functional but basic.

2. **Intermediate Approach**: Basic market condition evaluation.
   - **Rationale**: Avoid obviously bad entries.
   - **Outcome**: Minor improvement.

3. **Current Approach**: Strategy pattern implementation with technical indicators (MA, RSI), specific strategies (MA Crossover), backtesting, and optimization frameworks.
   - **Rationale**: Enable structured strategy development, testing, and selection.
   - **Outcome**: Significantly more robust and extensible strategy system.

4. **Planned Approach**: Develop/integrate more advanced strategies, potentially dynamic TP/SL or volume analysis.
   - **Rationale**: Improve profitability and adaptability.
   - **Status**: Planning/Development.

### Risk Management Evolution
1. **Initial Approach**: Fixed stop-loss.
   - **Rationale**: Basic loss limitation.
   - **Outcome**: Limited individual trade loss.

2. **Intermediate Approach**: Fixed stop-loss + daily trade limit.
   - **Rationale**: Limit daily exposure.
   - **Outcome**: Better daily risk control.

3. **Current Approach**: Dedicated Risk Manager module (`internal/risk`) handling daily limits and potentially other checks. Fixed position sizing still default.
   - **Rationale**: Centralize risk logic.
   - **Outcome**: Cleaner architecture, foundation for advanced rules.

4. **Planned Approach**: Implement dynamic position sizing (potentially volatility-based or risk-adjusted) within the Risk Manager. Consider circuit breakers.
   - **Rationale**: Adapt risk dynamically to market conditions and capital.
   - **Status**: Planning/Development.

### Technical Architecture Evolution
1. **Initial Approach**: Monolithic `main.go`.
   - **Rationale**: Quick PoC.
   - **Outcome**: Difficult to maintain/test.

2. **Intermediate Approach**: Basic package separation (config, database, trading).
   - **Rationale**: Improve organization.
   - **Outcome**: Better structure, but tight coupling remained.

3. **Current Approach**: Clean Architecture / Ports & Adapters (`internal/domain`, `internal/app`, `internal/ports`, `internal/adapters`). Interface-driven design.
   - **Rationale**: Decoupling, testability, maintainability, adherence to best practices.
   - **Outcome**: Highly modular, testable, and maintainable codebase.

4. **Planned Approach**: Refine existing adapters/ports as needed, ensure strict adherence to dependency rules.
   - **Rationale**: Continuous improvement.
   - **Status**: Ongoing refinement.
