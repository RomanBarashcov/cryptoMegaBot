## Current Status

### Project Status: Alpha
The bot is functional but requires further development and testing before production use. Core trading functionality is implemented, but the trading strategy is basic and requires refinement.

### Development Status
- **Last Major Update**: Initial implementation of core trading functionality
- **Current Focus**: Improving trading strategy and error handling
- **Next Milestone**: Implementing technical indicators for better trade decisions

### Testing Status
- **Unit Tests**: Not yet implemented
- **Integration Tests**: Not yet implemented
- **Manual Testing**: Basic functionality tested in testnet environment
- **Known Issues**: See "Known Issues" section below

### Deployment Status
- **Environment**: Local development only
- **Containerization**: Docker configuration complete but not fully tested
- **Production Readiness**: Not ready for production use

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **WebSocket Stability**: ✅ FIXED - Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - **Previous Impact**: Bot could miss price updates and trading opportunities
   - **Solution**: Added robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - **Benefits**: Improved reliability, no manual intervention needed for connection drops

2. **Error Handling**: Some API errors are not properly handled
   - **Impact**: Bot may crash on certain API failures
   - **Workaround**: Monitor bot and restart if necessary
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement comprehensive error handling for all API calls

### Major Issues
1. **Trading Strategy**: Current implementation is too basic
   - **Impact**: Suboptimal trading decisions
   - **Workaround**: Manually adjust configuration parameters
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement more sophisticated strategy with technical indicators

2. **Position Sizing**: Fixed position size doesn't account for volatility
   - **Impact**: Risk may be too high in volatile conditions
   - **Workaround**: Manually adjust position size in configuration
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement dynamic position sizing based on volatility

### Minor Issues
1. **Logging**: Limited logging makes debugging difficult
   - **Impact**: Harder to diagnose issues
   - **Workaround**: Add print statements as needed
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement comprehensive logging system

2. **Configuration**: No validation for some parameters
   - **Impact**: Invalid configuration may cause unexpected behavior
   - **Workaround**: Carefully check configuration before starting
   - **Planned Fix**: Add comprehensive configuration validation

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Trading Strategy Evolution
1. **Initial Approach**: Simple market order entry with fixed take-profit and stop-loss
   - **Rationale**: Start with simplest possible implementation
   - **Outcome**: Functional but not optimal for profitability

2. **Current Approach**: Basic market condition evaluation before entry
   - **Rationale**: Avoid entering in unfavorable conditions
   - **Outcome**: Improved but still needs refinement

3. **Planned Approach**: Technical indicator-based strategy with trend analysis
   - **Rationale**: More sophisticated analysis should improve results
   - **Status**: In planning phase

### Risk Management Evolution
1. **Initial Approach**: Fixed stop-loss at 0.25%
   - **Rationale**: Minimize losses on each trade
   - **Outcome**: Effective at limiting individual trade losses

2. **Current Approach**: Fixed stop-loss with daily trade limit
   - **Rationale**: Limit overall daily risk exposure
   - **Outcome**: Better overall risk control

3. **Planned Approach**: Dynamic position sizing and volatility-adjusted stops
   - **Rationale**: Adapt risk to market conditions
   - **Status**: In planning phase

### Technical Architecture Evolution
1. **Initial Approach**: Monolithic design with all logic in main.go
   - **Rationale**: Quick implementation for proof of concept
   - **Outcome**: Functional but difficult to maintain

2. **Current Approach**: Separated concerns into packages with clearer structure
   - **Rationale**: Improve maintainability and organization
   - **Outcome**: Better code organization but still room for improvement

3. **Planned Approach**: More modular design with interfaces for testability
   - **Rationale**: Improve testability and flexibility
   - **Status**: Partially implemented
